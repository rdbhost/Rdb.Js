 
## The Javascript Module for Accessing Rdbhost
## jquery.rdbhost.js ##

### Dependencies ###
This module requires jQuery.  Version 1.5 or greater is recommended.
Use with Internet Explorer 7 requires json2.js also.

### Overview ###
The module includes a class, *SQLEngine*, that encapsulates the interactions with the server, and a jQuery plugin.  The class can be used directly, without the plugin, but the plugin is intended to be easier. This document describes the plugin.  For help in using the SQLEngine object directly, there is decent commenting in the source.

There were recently three different versions of this module.  There is now one, and it will dynamically use ajax in browsers that support CORS, and easyXDM otherwise.  If easyXDM is not loaded, but yepnope.js or Modernizr is, then easyXDM will be dynamically loaded as necessary.

This document attempts to provide an overview of the module, and tell you enough to do useful things with the library.  There is much more to know about the service, documented on the site:


Some features of the service:

* binary uploads
* raw binary downloads
* json or xml
* deferred queries with higher time limits


### The Plugin ###
Included are fourteen _functions_ (called on the Rdbhost global object) and four _methods_ (called on jQuery selection sets).  Most of them take option objects as their only or second parameter.

The _functions_ are on a global 'Rdbhost' or 'window.Rdbhost' namespace.  The _methods_ are on the jQuery _$_ namespace, as they act on jQuery selection sets.  Some of the _functions_ are aliased to the _$_ namespace as well.  The examples below assume the global Rdbhost object has been aliased to a variable R, as in 'var R = window.Rdbhost;'.

### Options ###
Before we discuss the functions and methods themselves, let's go over the options.  Some are required, some optional (a _required_ _option_ ? yep).  A default can be set for each, via the $.rdbHostConfig function, or included in each function or method call.

* *userName:* PostgreSQL rolename used for the connection; rolename is 10 digit account number, preceded by 's', 'a', 'p', or 'r'. *required*

* *authcode:* 'authentication code' for role.  50 base-64 digits. *required*

* *q:* the query, in SQL.  Either _q_ or _kw_ is *required*.

* *kw:* a lookup keyword, used to lookup a query pre-stored on the server.  Either _q_ or _kw_ is *required*.

* *args:* an array with arguments to replace substitution tokens in the query string.  The number of _args_ elements should match the number of substitution tokens in the query string.  Can be used with _kw_ s also, in which case the args interpolate into the query string on the server.

* *namedParams:* an object with named attributes.  The params are referenced in the query string with tokens like _%(paramName)_.

* *format:* either _json_ or _json-easy_. default = _json-easy_.

* *repeat:* an integer >= 1, indicating the query is to be duplicated, and _repeat_ copies submitted as one transaction.  Supply enough arguments to satisfy the whole transaction.

* *domain:* what rdbhost server are you using?  default www.rdbhost.com

* *callback:* a function that gets called with the data, once data is received.  Used by functions, not by methods.
Not required, but the default is a basic _*JSON*_ dump and probably not what you want.

* *errback:* a function that gets called when there is an error in the data retrieval.  Default raises an exception.

* *eachrec:* the $.eachRecord function calls this, for each record, in lieu of _callback_.


### Data Format ###

See [json response format](http://www.rdbhost.com/result-formats.html), for details, but here is a quick overview:

* the records will be Javascript objects as a Javascript array in data.records.rows, where data is the parameter name your callback function used to receive the result data.
* data.status[0] will be either 'incomplete' or 'complete', depending on whether the Rdbhost records-per-request limit was exceeded.  The data.status[0] will never be 'error', since errors result in calling errback in lieu of callback.


### Functions ###

* *$.rdbHostConfig:* Stores its options as the default for all subsequent functions. It can accept *any* or *all* of the options.

* *$.postData:* used to submit data to server, similar to an $.ajax call.  This method ends query to server, gets results, calls callback with single result object as the parameter.
Requires _callback_ and _q_ or _kw_.

        $.ready(function () {
            $.postData( { kw : 'logthispage',
                          args : [ 'test page loaded' ],
                          callback : function(){ ... } });
        });

  or, using promises,

        $.ready(function () {
        
            var p = $.postData( {kw: 'logthispage',
                                 args: ['test page loaded']  });
        
            p.done(function() { ... });
        
        });
        


    The above examples assumes that _userName_, and _authcode_ have been set as defaults.
The _q_ query string (or the on-server query string referenced by _kw_) may include '%s' substition tokens, and an _args_ options must then be provided, with an element for each such token. Any response data from the server will be passed to the callback.


[see demo here](http://www.paginaswww.com/rdb/examples/jq_rdbhost_exdm_post.html)

* *$.postFormData:* used to submit data to server, where the data is in an html form. Call this function before the form gets submitted, not from a *submit* or *click* handler on the form:

        $.postFormData($('#demo-form'), {
            'kw': 'updater',
            'callback': redisplay
        });
        
  or, using promises:
  
        var p = $.postFormData($('#demo-form'), {
            'kw': 'updater' 
        });
        
        p.done(redisplay);
        

    The above example assumes that _userName_, and _authcode_ have been set as defaults. _kw_ could have been provided as a field value in the form.  _redisplay_ is a function that does some appropriate followup action.

    The form *must* include a unique _id_.  Form fields can include _q_, _kw_, _format_, _arg###_ (where ### is a 3 digit number, '0' padded, starting with '000'), and _argtype###_.
    The _q_ query string (or the on-server query string referenced by _kw_) may include '%s' substition tokens, and an _arg###_ field may be provided for each such token.
    _arg###_ fields may be *file* fields, and this is the surest way to submit binary data with the query.
    The _argtype###_ fields are optional, but (if provided) should be numbered to match _arg###_ fields, and each value should be a Python DB API type string ('STRING', 'NUMBER', 'BINARY', ...). These are used by the server to typecast the argument values before passing them to PostgreSQL.

    Response data from the server will be passed to the callback.

    Remember to avoid the use of '.preventDefault()' and 'return false', as the form itself does get submitted.

    It is also recommended to explicitly set 'enctype' and 'method' attributes on the form.

    [see demo here](http://www.paginaswww.com/rdb/examples/jq_rdbhost_exdm_postbyform.html)

* *$.withResults:* functionally identical to $.postData.

* *$.eachRecord:* sends query to server, gets results, calls _errback_ if status is 'error', otherwise, calls _eachrec_ callback with each record.  By default, the _jsond-easy_ format is used, and each record is an object with named attribute for each record field.

* *R.getGET:* returns a string with url containing the query; can be requested using $.ajax or $http...  (with GET method)

        $.ready(function () {

            $.ajax({
                url : R.getGET({
                          userName: 'preauth',
                          q: 'INSERT INTO status (event) VALUES(%S)',
                          args: [ 'test page loaded' ],
                          format: 'json-easy'
                        },
                method: 'GET',
                callback: function(resp) { ... }
            });
        });

* *R.getPOST:* returns an object containing a url and a data object; can be requested using $.ajax or $htt... (with POST method)

        $.ready(function () {

            var postDataObj = R.getPOST({
                userName: 'super',
                q: 'INSERT INTO status (event) VALUES(%S)',
                args: [ 'test page loaded' ],
                format: 'json-easy',
                authcode: 'abc~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~xyz'
            });

            $.ajax({
                url: postDataObj.url,
                method: 'POST',
                data: postDataObj.data,
                callback: function(resp) { ... }
            });
        });

* *R.provideSuperPOST:* like $.getPOST, but returns a promise instead of the object.  If necessary, will prompt for email/pass and use R.superLogin to retrieve authcode.

        var options = {
            userName: 'super',
            q: 'INSERT INTO status (event) VALUES(%S)',
            args: [ 'test page loaded' ],
            format: 'json-easy',
            authcode: '' // to be obtained interactively by provideSuperPOST
        };

        R.provideSuperPOST(options, function(postDataObj) {

            $.ajax({
                url: postDataObj.url,
                method: 'POST',
                data: postDataObj.data,
                callback: function(resp) { ... }
            });
        })

* *$.loginAjax:* sends your email and password to server, gets list of roles and authcodes.

        $.ready(function() {

            function logIn(resp) { // resp is ordinary Rdbhost results object

              var recs = resp.results.rows;
              ... do something with rolename/authcode data
            };

            var liPromise = $.loginAjax({

                email: 'dkeeney@rdbhost.com',
                password: '~~~',
            });

            liPromise.then(logIn, alert); // when data available, pass to function logIn.
        });

    R.superLogin is generally easier to use, with the same utility.


* *$.loginOpenID:* enables logging users in via OpenID logins.  This handles your users logging in to your app, not you logging in to your Rdbhost account.  This function does NOT return a promise, so you need to provide a callback.

    This function should be called early in your ready function, or after the form is loaded, before any user interaction or need for user id.  It has two distinct functions: 1) if page is being loaded on return from OpenID provider site, the function pulls the user's key and identifier from hash or cookie (depending on which is available), and provides those to the callback; and 2) if page load is before the login, it prepares the provided form for a login.

        var userId = 'anonymous';

        function logUserIn(identifier, key) { // identifier is OpenID identifier, key is
                                              //  secret from local user db, originally random
            // user identification can be stored in cookies.
            $.cookie('loginKeyName', key);
            $.cookie('loginIdentifier', identifier);
            userId = identifier;
            $('#userId').text(userId);
        };

        $.ready(function() {

            $.loginOpenID({

                loginForm: 'formname', // id of html form in page
                callback: logUserIn
            });
        });


    [see demo here](http://www.paginaswww.com/rdb/examples/openid-login.html)

* *R.trainAjax:* sends your email and password to server, puts server account in training mode for a few seconds only, for your client IP.  Using this directly will rarely be required, in that R.preauthPostData and R.preauthPostFormData are easier methods for the common use-cases.

* *R.superLogin:* similar to $.loginAjax, except will prompt (with html dialog) for missing email and password.

* *R.superPostData:* like $.postData with _super_ role, but will prompt using R.superLogin to get authcode if
necessary.

* *R.superPostFormData:* like $.postFormData with _super_ role, but will prompt using R.superLogin to get authcode
if necessary.

* *R.preauthPostData:* like $.postData with _preauth_ role, but will prompt for email/pass and use R.trainAjax to temporarily start training mode if necessary.

* *R.preauthPostFormData:* like $.postFormData with _preauth_ role, but will prompt for email/pass and use R.trainAjax to temporarily start training mode if necessary.

* *R.drawLoginDialog:* draws dialog box, calls callback function with entered input.



### Methods ###

* *$.fn.rdbhostSubmit:* waits for Connection to be ready, and submits form.
Only meaningful on submittable selection items such as forms, and should be used in preference to .submit() where the form has been prepared by $.postFormData, for submitting form data to Rdbhost.com.
Has no .rdbhostSubmit( function () {..} ) variant.

* *$.fn.populateTable:* sends query to server, gets results, and populates an html table with the data, one row per record.
If called on an empty _table_, it will create rows to match the records.
If called on a _div_, it will create a new _table_ in that _div_, and proceed as above.
If called on a table with pre-defined rows, it puts the data into cells based on matching the field name to the _td_ cell's _class_ value. If any class in the cell matches the field name, that is a match.

[see demo here](http://www.paginaswww.com/rdb/examples/jq_rdbhost_exdm_table.html)

* *$.fn.populateForm:* sends query to server, gets results, and populates an html form with the data in the first record.
It attempts to match each field name to an input field with matching _id_, and then attempts to match an input field with matching _class_-name.

[see demo here](http://www.paginaswww.com/rdb/examples/jq_rdbhost_exdm_formpop.html)

* *$.fn.datadump:* sends query, gets results, formats the data as a pretty-printed JSON string, and inserts it into each item in the selection set.  Intended as a diagnostic aid.

### SQLEngine ###
Documentation for the engine itself is in the source code.  Examples can be found in the 'examples' directory.  The datatables* examples all use the plain SQLEngine, rather than the plugin.
